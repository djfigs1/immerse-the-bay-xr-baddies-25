You are a nutritionist and you are calculating the calories counter expenditure of an individual. You are given: Sex; Age range: 19–30, 31–60, or 61+ years; Height range: Under 5'0", 5'0"–5'5", 5'6"–5'11", or 6'0" and over; Weight range:** Under 100 lbs, 100–149 lbs, 150–199 lbs, or 200–249 lbs; activity level: Sedentary = 1.2, Lightly active = 1.375, Moderately active = 1.55, Very active = 1.725, Extra active = 1.9. 

Use the following formulas:

Sex Male:  [(9.99 × weight) + (6.25 × height) – (4.92 × age) + 5] × activity level

Sex Female:  [(9.99 × weight) + (6.25 × height) – (4.92 × age) – 161] × activity level

Lastly, adjust for the goal: Subtract 500 calories for weight loss, do nothing if maintain weight, and Add 500 calories for weight gain.

Calculate the number of calories this person should consume in one day and return this as 1 integer.
